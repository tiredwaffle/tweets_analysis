# Analysis of Twitter users' posts related to Coronavirus: Analysis of time series of mention of proper names

This is university project for the Text Mining Course.

In the last few months, a pandemic of the new COVID-19 virus has swept the world. With the closure of cinemas, shops, malls, all human communication moved to the Internet. All discussions and debates swept through social networks: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Vkontakte were flooded with daily reports of deaths or new cases, theories about the origin of the virus, or hopes for a quick end of the quarantine.
In this project, 5,000 tweets related to the coronavirus between March 1 and May 1, 2020, were removed for analysis.
Social networks have always been and remain indicators of user mood. For example, in the United States, studies have found a correlation between the analysis of tweets in a particular region and the crime rate. Our task is not so massive. Trying to  analyze in general tweets of the Ukrainian-language segment of Twitter on the topic of coronavirus, to analyze the time series of mentioning of certain countries, organizations or people and to understand their dynamics.

Twitter is a social network of microblogs that allows users to send short text messages (up to 280 characters) using SMS, instant messaging services and third-party client programs. Twitter has 330 million active users per month and 145 million daily Twitter users. That is, about 42% of Twitter users use the platform every day.

Currently, only ukrainian version of the project is available in the proper form. Though I am working on transforming it into article in english.
